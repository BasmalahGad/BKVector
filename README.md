# BKVector
BKVector is our version of C++ vector class with all the important functionalities implemented in it.
We tried to make it similer as much as possible to C++ vector by adding these features.
## Features:
* It is possible to create BKVector objects with all types of C++.
* Initializing BKVector with the values in the initializer list.
* Initializing BKVector by taking an array and the size of the array.
* Accessing item by index using ( [] operator ).
* Adding item at the BKVector end using ( push_back method ).
* Deleting item from the BKVector end or clear all the BKVector using ( pop_back and clear methods ).
* Adding item at the given position ( iterator ) using ( insert method ).
* Deleting the item at the given position ( iterator ) using ( erase method ).
* Deleting range of items given by two positions ( start iterator and end iterator ) using ( erase method ).
* Changing the BKVector size using ( resize method ) and doubling the size if it is needed in ( push_back and insert methods ).
* Returning the current size and capacity using ( size and capacity methods ). 
* Checking if the BKVector is empty or not using ( empty method ).
* Comparing two BKVectors using ( <, > and == operators ).
* Supporting iterators and all their operators ( *, ->, +, -, +=, -=, ++, and -- ).
* Comparing two iterators using ( <, >, <=, >=, == and != operators ).
* Using output stream with BKVector objects.
* Throwing exceptions in case of entering out of range index or invalid iterator.
* Supports all C++ algorithms (sort, reverse, ...etc).
